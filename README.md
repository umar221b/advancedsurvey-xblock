Install the Xblock into your OpenEdx Instance, then add it to a course in the Advanced Module List in Advanced Settings (add `"advancedsurvey"`).

Supports only two types of questions: Rating and Free Text questions. Check the default questions when you create a component to see the supported keys.

Future work should make creating questions more user-friendly, right now it works by specifiying a JSON.
